# progressive-decentralization

A place to explore common pain points and strategies around progressive decentralization (`company => community`DAOification). 

The focus in on projects that are evolving from a small team focused on shipping a product to an open decentralized community creating something people want to contribute to. We will outline a few case studies with common pain points. We will then collaboratively brainstorm potential solutions to said pain points. Then, if projects test these strategies out in the wild we can see what works and what doesn't. By open sourcing the strategies around common problems and their potential solutions we aim to find patterns and best practices that will be useful for many projects. As a result, hopefully the process of decentralization becomes easier for more projects in the space. 

A few things we want to explore:
- How do you shift from a company mindset to a community mindset?
- How do you engage the community in a meaningful way while the core team still has most of the power?
- Does the process look different for product teams shipping code vs DeFi protocols that manage protocol parameters?
- What tools can help with governance, value attribution, and incentive alignment?
- What teams are doing this well (both within crypto, but also in the open source world)?
